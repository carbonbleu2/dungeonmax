Trog, God of Violence and Rage

Trog, the god of violence and rage, is a figure revered in ancient texts. His devotees are commanded to kill in his name, and with each kill, Trog rewards them with unique weapons and powers.

Trog values close combat above all else and holds a deep disdain for ranged or magical attacks - particularly magic. Using skills not aligned with his domain will quickly diminish his favor. Excessive use of ranged attacks or unrelated skills will cause you to fall out of his grace entirely, resulting in automatic expulsion from his religion. Once banished, you will never be able to rejoin his worship.

Followers of Trog will find that their melee attacks and magic defenses grow stronger as they accumulate favor with the god.

However, deserters of Trog's faith face severe punishment. Not only will Trog strip them of all skills he has granted, but he will also significantly weaken their melee attacks. To make matters worse, Trog will occasionally summon bloodthirsty monsters at random stages to hunt them down.
